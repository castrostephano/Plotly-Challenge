# Plotly-Challenge

Outline: A dashboard with demographics, bar and bubble charts was created using D3, Plotly and functional Javascript programming 

Data Source: Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in participants in a scientific study of the navel area.

Methods: Used the ".filter" method, i parsed through the dataset to the ids of the participants in order to create a dropdown that controls the dashboard.
A function was created for the dropdown, then three more functions were created for the demographic, bar and bubble charts.
Then, using the event listener in the html, a final function called "optionchanged" was created in order to have each of the charts change based off the id that is selected.
